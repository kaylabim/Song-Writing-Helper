## Logline
A chilled R&B reflection on loneliness and small losses after a phone screen shatters — the broken glass becomes a mirror for a quiet heartbreak.

## Musical Ideas

**Chord Progression (Key D minor):** Verse: Dm7 | Bb | F | C  // Chorus: Dm7 | Gm7 | Bb | C  // Bridge: Bb | C | Dm7 | F | C

**Strumming/Feel:** soft broken 8ths (fingerpicked pocket): down - rest - down-up - down-up, laid-back behind the beat with light ghosted bass hits

**Melodic Hint:** Verse: re mi fa mi re do (lower register, intimate)  / Chorus: so la ti la so mi (lift to head voice on 'ti')  / Bridge: fa so la so fa re (wider leaps, resolve back to re)

## Lyrics

### Intro


### Verse_1
I dropped my world onto the sidewalk
Glass like a map with all the streets gone dark
You used to live inside that tiny blue light
Now stars are crawling where your name used to spark

### Pre_Chorus_1


### Chorus
Broke my phone screen, all the faces are fractured
Every notification feels farther than before
Broke my phone screen, and the silence answers
Can’t swipe you back, can’t bring you through the door

### Verse_2
I watch the cracks spread like the words we never said
A thousand tiny edges echo in my head
Pictures skip and freeze at the corner of your smile
I try to scroll past, but I stay there for a while

### Pre_Chorus_2


### Bridge
Maybe I mistook you for a signal, a light on the line
Maybe replacing glass won’t fix the shape of time
If you ever pass by, don’t call — just stand in the rain
I’d rather see you whole than in a broken frame

### Outro


## Production Notes
Tempo 72 BPM, key D minor. Keep arrangement sparse and warm: electric piano (EP with slow attack) comping on beat, subtle Rhodes pad, warm sub bass holding root notes, brushed/snare rim with soft kick on 1 and light syncopation, and tasteful vinyl/room reverb for atmosphere. Lead vocal intimate and breathy in verses, add doubled harmony a third above on chorus lines; use light stacked falsetto on final chorus repeats. Use Dm7 and Gm7 voicings with color tones (9th or add11 in voicings), but not required in notation — keep chords labeled as in progression. For the bridge, strip back to voice and minimal keys for a moment of vulnerability, then bring pads and layered background harmonies back for the final chorus. Avoid heavy percussion or aggressive synths; aim for warm, late-night R&B minimalism.
